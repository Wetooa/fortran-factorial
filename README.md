### **Objective**

This project demonstrates the computation of factorials using both iterative and recursive approaches in the Fortran programming language.

---

### **Program Description**

The program accepts an integer input (`n`) from the user and calculates its factorial using two methods:

1. **Iterative Method**: A loop-based approach to calculate the factorial.
2. **Recursive Method**: A function that calls itself to compute the factorial.

---

### **Features**

- Accepts an integer input (`n`) from the user.
- Computes factorial iteratively and recursively.
- Displays the results of both computations for comparison.

---

### **Usage Instructions**

1. Compile the program using a Fortran compiler such as `gfortran`:

   ```bash
   gfortran factorial.f90 -o factorial
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./factorial
   ```

3. Enter a positive integer when prompted, and the program will display:
   - The factorial computed iteratively.
   - The factorial computed recursively.
